# My CodeBook for JHU/Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data" End of Course Project
This codebook is meant to augment the README and MyNotes background files located in this REPO for my final project entry.

This CodeBook is divided into three sections:
1) Data
2) Variables
3) Transformations

## 1) Data
* This project is reliant upon a .zip file titled: "UCI HAR Dataset.zip", which is hosted by University of California Irvine's Machine Learning Repository. Additional information on this dataset can be found in the README file.

* This project outputs a new, clean & tidy dataset in the form of a text file containing space separated values titled: "tidy_data_set_submission.txt"
